    <h5 id="special">Fred Rogers considered the number “143” to be a very special number. He once said, “It takes one letter to say I and four letters to say love and three letters to say you. One hundred and forty-three.” In fact, he liked the number so much that he maintained the weight of 143 pounds for the last 30 years of his life.</h5>
